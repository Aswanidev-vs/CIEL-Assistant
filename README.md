CIEL: Conversational AI Chatbot

CIEL is a conversational AI chatbot built using Go, Fyne, and Google's Generative AI API. This chatbot allows users to interact with a conversational AI model, generating human-like responses to user input.

Features
Conversational AI model using Google's Generative AI API
Text-to-speech functionality using HTGO-TTS
Adjustable playback speed for audio responses
Responsive UI built using Fyne
Usage
Run the application using go run main.go
Interact with the chatbot by typing messages in the input field
The chatbot will respond with a generated response, which will be displayed in the chat history
The response will also be spoken aloud using the text-to-speech functionality
Configuration
The Generative AI API key is hardcoded in the main.go file. You will need to replace this with your own API key.
The audio files generated by the chatbot are stored in the audio folder. You can customize the folder location by modifying the speech struct in the main.go file.
Technical Details
The chatbot uses the Fyne framework to build a responsive UI.
The Generative AI API is used to generate human-like responses to user input.
The HTGO-TTS library is used to convert text to speech.
The ffmpeg command-line tool is used to adjust the playback speed of the audio files.
